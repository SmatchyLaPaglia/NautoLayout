 # NautoLayout
 
 %$^&@! AutoLayout. In the time I've spent wrestling with that s**t and trying to stop it from crashing everything I could have finished my whole damn project. 
 
 Here is an XCode Playground with a spit-simple set of extensions to UIView. These let you accomplish simple tasks like laying out subviews uniformly along either the x or y axis, and defining the origin of any given view proportionally to its superview. It's a little more work to set up than AutoLayout, but tweaking it, revising it, and debugging it are a _lot_ less work than struggling with AutoLayout.
 
 At the end of the Playground there are examples that demonstrate functionality.
